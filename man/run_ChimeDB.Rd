\title{Step 1: Map mouse -> human at raw-count level, VST per species, then merge}
\usage{
run_ChimeDB(
  human_file,
  mouse_file,
  host = "https://dec2021.archive.ensembl.org/"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{human_file}{Path to human raw counts (must include columns Control_1..3, Treatment_1..3, symbol).}

\item{mouse_file}{Path to mouse raw counts (same columns as human).}

\item{host}{Ensembl archive host for biomaRt.}
}
\value{
list(combined, ortholog_map) where \code{combined} is a numeric matrix with columns
Control_Mouse_1..3, Treatment_Mouse_1..3, Control_Human_1..3, Treatment_Human_1..3;
\code{ortholog_map} is a list with elements: m2h_full (data.frame), h2m_all (list),
h2m_rep (named character), m2h_rep (named character).
}
\description{
Reads two raw count tables (columns: Control_1..3, Treatment_1..3, symbol).
First, mouse gene symbols are mapped to representative human symbols
(one2one preferred, otherwise the highest \%id) and mouse counts are
aggregated per human symbol \strong{at the raw-count level}. Then DESeq2 size
factors and VST are computed separately for the (mapped) mouse matrix and
the human matrix. Finally, the union of genes is taken and matrices are merged.
